JIT known as (Just In Time Compiler) As we know that when the Java program is executed, the byte code is interpreted by 
JVM.But this process is a slower process.It takes so much Time,So to overcome this Problem JIT(Just In Time Compiler) is 
added in the JRE.It makes the execution faster.If the JIT Compiler library is available, when a particular bytecode is 
executed first time, JIT complier compiles bytecode into  machine code which can be directly executed by the machine in 
which the Java program runs.Once the byte code is recompiled by JIT compiler, the execution time needed is less.
